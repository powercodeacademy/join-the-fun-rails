# Join the Fun

## Instructions

Flatiron School has started its own taxi service, FlatironX, and we need to
start developing the application's domain model!

Three basic models have already been created, `Passenger`, `Ride`, and `Taxi`.
Just run `bin/rails db:migrate` and `bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` to apply the
migrations to the development and test databases, respectively.

The next step is set up a `has_many :through` relationship between
these three models so that we can keep track of who's driving who around.
It will work like this:

```txt
Taxi -< Rides >- Passengers
```

- A Taxi has many Rides
- A Taxi has many Passengers through Rides
- A Ride belongs to a Taxi and a Passenger
- A Passenger has many Rides
- A Passenger has many Taxis through Rides

Each table only has a primary key, so you'll need to write a migration to
get the database ready to handle the "has_many :through" relationship and
add the required columns to establish this relationship.

Check out the join table section in the [Active Record Association Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-many-through-association).

Run the tests using the `bin/rspec` command.
